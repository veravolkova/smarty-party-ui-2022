## Project Description

The project is a gift planning website. The idea is that a holiday organizer creates a list of desired gifts and provides guests\
with an access (is created manually in the database or through POST request).\

Guests can reserve (as well as release) a gift that they like, can also suggest their own gifts, filter, edit, and remove gifts.\
In future they would also have an opportunity to comment on gifts (implementation in process) so that they can ask any related questions.
Attendance confirmation functionality is also on the to do list.

## Main Pages

### Home page
A starter page with general information (Birthday date and photo in our case).

### Gifts page
A gift page with a full list of gifts than can be filtered (All, Reserved by Me, Available).\
Here gifts can be reserved, released, and removed (if a user is an admin or a gift owner, i.e. the gift is reserved by this user).\
Upon clicking on a gift, a user navigates to the gift details page.

### Gift details page
Name, description of a gift, and its URL (if any) are provided. A user can edit a gift (if an admin user or owner).

### Users page
A full list of guests. Upon clicking on a name, a user navigates to the guest/user details page.

### User details page
A full list of gifts reserved by a user.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the unit test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

If you arenâ€™t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

### `npm run server`

Runs a simple http server to serve static resource files from a local directory. Used for development and testing purposes. 

### `npm run eslint`

Runs ESLint on any file or directory for identifying and reporting on patterns.

### `npm run cypress:open`
